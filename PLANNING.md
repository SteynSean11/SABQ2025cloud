## Your Project Bible: Personal Budgeting Web App for South African Users

Last Updated: 2025-07-03
Purpose: This document contains everything your AI coding assistant needs to understand the project: architecture decisions, technology stack, South African requirements, security considerations, and development approach. It's the single source of truth for all technical decisions. It should always be read at the start of any new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints.

---

# üéØ Project Vision & Goals

---

## Primary Objective

The primary objective is to create an automated, individualized, and user-friendly personal budgeting web application specifically designed for middle-aged South Africans facing economic pressures. The application must be culturally aware, economically relevant, and accessible across various devices and connection speeds. The overarching goal is to empower individuals and families to achieve financial freedom through smart budgeting, practical education, and community support, ultimately helping them "live like royalty on any budget".

## Target Users

The application primarily targets young South African women (22-35 years old) who are starting their careers or managing young families. This demographic seeks practical, relatable advice to make their money go further, save for goals, and feel financially empowered. The initial broader vision also included middle-aged South Africans (35-55 years).

Users are described as having mixed technical proficiency, so the app must be intuitive for non-technical users. They primarily use mobile devices, with occasional desktop access, and may experience intermittent connectivity due to load shedding and data costs. They face common financial challenges like "black tax," high data costs, and varying costs of living.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

---

### System Type

The system is envisioned as a Progressive Web Application (PWA) with offline capabilities. It will feature a microservices backend architecture and a mobile-first responsive design. The application should be cloud-hosted, with a preference for South African data centers to ensure low latency and compliance. It uses a pnpm monorepo structure to manage frontend and backend codebases within a single repository while keeping them decoupled.

### High-Level Components

1.  Frontend Layer: A React PWA with offline sync capabilities.
2.  API Gateway: GraphQL with REST fallbacks.
3.  Microservices: Includes User Management, Budget Engine, Transaction Processor, Notification Service, and Reporting Service.
4.  Data Layer: Utilizes PostgreSQL as the primary database, Redis for caching, and InfluxDB for analytics.
5.  External Integrations: Connections to major South African banks, SARS (South African Revenue Service), and economic data APIs.

### Monorepo Structure

‚Ä¢ Monorepo Root (/): Contains shared configurations (.prettierrc.json, tsconfig.base.json), package.json with root scripts, and documentation.
‚Ä¢ apps/web: The Next.js 14 frontend application, serving as the user interface.
‚Ä¢ apps/api: The Express.js backend application, serving the REST API.
‚Ä¢ packages/*: Shared code used by both web and API apps, including:
‚ó¶ @sabq/ui: Reusable React components.
‚ó¶ @sabq/tailwind-config: Centralized Tailwind CSS configuration.
‚ó¶ @sabq/validation: Shared Zod validation schemas.

    *   **Body Text & UI Elements**: A clean, modern, and highly legible Sans-Serif font (e.g., Montserrat, Lato, Open Sans, Nunito, Roboto) for practical advice readability.
    *   **Accent Text**: A decorative, Gothic-style script for special artistic elements, used sparingly.

*   **Iconography & Motifs**:
    *   **Primary Logo**: The green money bag with gold embellishments.
    *   **Primary Brand Icon**: The green leafy crown. Use as favicon, section headers, loading icon, watermark.
    *   **Secondary Icons**: Classic gold crowns for decorative elements or achievement badges.
    *   **UI Icons**: Clean, modern, single-weight line-icon set, rendered in Gold for a premium feel. Lucide Icons for UI icons.

### Style Guide

This style guide is the single source of truth for all visual design and ensures a consistent user experience. All new components and pages must adhere to these guidelines.

#### 1. Colors

The color palette is designed to be modern, trustworthy, and empowering.

| Role                 | Color Name             | Hex Code                               | Usage                                                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Primary Action**   | Rich Emerald Green     | `#0A422D` or `#03322A`                  | Primary buttons, active links, key headings, and important icons.  |
| **Primary Accent**   | Warm Metallic Gold     | `#D4AF37` or `#B19433`                  | Secondary buttons, accent borders, and decorative elements.        |
| **Background**       | Clean Off-White/Cream  | `#F8F7F4` or `#F8F8F8`                  | Main background color for content areas to ensure readability.     |
| **Text & Contrast**  | Deep Charcoal/Off-Black| `#212121`                              | Body text, headings, and other UI elements for high contrast.      |
| **Critical Alert**   | Ruby Red               | `#9B111E` or `#A52A2A`                  | Error messages, critical alerts, and destructive action buttons.   |
| **High-Energy CTA**  | Magenta/Bright Pink    | `#E91E63`                              | High-priority calls-to-action or interactive promotional elements. |
| **Subtle Accent**    | Vibrant Leaf Green     | `#4CAF50`                              | Success states, progress indicators, or subtle positive feedback.  |

#### 2. Typography

Typography is chosen for its blend of elegance and readability.

| Element                   | Font Family                               | Weight(s)         | Notes                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Headings & Branding**   | Playfair Display, Lora (or similar Serif) | Bold, Semi-Bold   | Used for `h1`, `h2`, `h3` to convey authority and elegance.        |
| **Body Text & UI**        | Montserrat, Lato, Open Sans (Sans-Serif)  | Regular, Medium   | Used for paragraphs, labels, and all UI elements for clarity.      |
| **Accent/Decorative**     | (Gothic-style script)                     | Regular           | Used sparingly for special artistic elements or branding moments.  |

#### 3. Spacing & Layout

We use a consistent, 4-pixel based grid system for all spacing (margins, padding, gaps). This aligns with Tailwind CSS's default spacing scale.

-   **Base Unit**: `1 unit = 4px`
-   **Small Gaps**: `2 units (8px)`, `3 units (12px)`
-   **Standard Gaps**: `4 units (16px)`, `6 units (24px)`
-   **Large Gaps**: `8 units (32px)`, `12 units (48px)`

#### 4. Component States

All interactive components must have visually distinct states to provide clear user feedback.

| State      | Style                                                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Default**| The component's standard appearance.                               |
| **Hover**  | A subtle change in background color, border, or shadow to indicate interactivity. |
| **Focus**  | A visible outline (e.g., a ring) to aid keyboard navigation and accessibility. |
| **Active** | A more pronounced change (e.g., darker background) to show the component is being pressed. |
| **Disabled**| Reduced opacity and the `not-allowed` cursor to indicate the component is non-interactive. |

### Imagery (Crucial for "No Face" Strategy)

‚ó¶ Avoid generic stock photos of people; prefer high-quality, warm, authentic imagery.
‚ó¶ Focus on "no-face" close-ups of hands engaging with money, groceries, cooking, budgeting apps, notebooks.
‚ó¶ Visually integrate SA context: flat lays of grocery hauls from SA stores (Checkers, Woolworths, Pick n Pay), typical SA food items, subtle background cues of SA homes/landscapes, load-shedding survival hacks.
‚ó¶ Use stylized screenshots of budget templates in action.
‚ó¶ Employ custom-designed infographics using brand colors to explain financial concepts.
‚ó¶ For the "R5000 Family Feast" series, use animated infographics, time-lapses of meal prep, and close-ups of ingredients and cooking processes.

## üöÄ Development Approach

---

### Methodology

‚Ä¢ Agile Development: 2-week sprints.
‚Ä¢ User-Centered Design: Regular user testing.
‚Ä¢ Continuous Integration: Automated testing and deployment.
‚Ä¢ Progressive Enhancement: Core features first, enhancements layered.

### Quality Standards

    ‚Ä¢ Code Coverage: Minimum 80% test coverage.
    ‚Ä¢ Performance: Lighthouse score 90+ on mobile; page load time < 2s on 3G.
    ‚Ä¢ Security: Regular penetration testing and ongoing security audits.
    ‚Ä¢ Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
    ‚Ä¢ Browser Support: Modern browsers (ES2020+).
    ‚Ä¢ Code Quality: ESLint + Prettier configuration enforced. Strict TypeScript configuration. Small, focused functions (max 20-30 lines). File size limit (no single file should exceed 500 lines; refactor into smaller modules). Consistent naming conventions. JSDoc comments for all exported functions. Inline comments for complex logic (explaining the "why").

### Testing

*   **Primary Framework**: **Vitest** is the designated testing framework for this project.
*   **Component Testing**: Done using **React Testing Library** alongside Vitest.
*   **E2E Testing**: To be done with Playwright for critical user journeys.
*   **Test-Driven Foundation**: All new features or logic must be accompanied by tests covering expected use, edge cases, and failure cases.

### AI-Assisted Development Workflow

  * **Contextual Sandbox**: This project utilizes a "contextual sandbox" to guide the Gemini CLI. This is managed through a set of instructional markdown files.
  * **Hierarchical Context**: The CLI is configured to load a global `CONTEXTUAL-GUARDRAIL.md` file from the project root, as well as more specific `GEMINI.md` files located within application sub-directories (e.g., `apps/api/`). This provides a focused and efficient context for the AI.
  * **Master Rulebook**: The `CONTEXTUAL-GUARDRAIL.md` file contains the master set of rules and constraints for all development.

### Dependency Audit Workflow

A recurring process for reviewing dependencies is crucial for project security.

1.  **Run the Audit**: Regularly run `pnpm audit` to check for known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
2.  **Review Vulnerabilities**: Analyze the audit report to identify the severity and impact of each vulnerability.
3.  **Apply Updates**: Whenever possible, update packages to a non-vulnerable version using `pnpm update [package-name]`.
4.  **Manual Review**: If a direct update is not available, investigate the vulnerability to assess its actual impact on the project. Document any findings and mitigation strategies.
5.  **Documentation**: Keep a log of audited dependencies and any actions taken.

### Development Phases

*   **Phase 1 (3-4 months)**: MVP with core budgeting features.
*   **Phase 2 (2-3 months)**: Enhanced features and integrations.
*   **Phase 3 (3-4 months)**: AI features and advanced planning tools.

### Key Development Principles & Workflow

‚Ä¢ Always read PLANNING.md and check TASK.md before starting new work. If a task isn't listed, add it.
‚Ä¢ Monorepo Structure: Place new features in appropriate apps/* directory; feature-specific logic should be modularized (e.g., apps/web/src/features/budget).
‚Ä¢ Components: Reusable UI components in apps/web/src/components/ui. Shared generic components in @sabq/ui package; web-specific components in apps/web/src/components.
‚Ä¢ Styling: Use Tailwind CSS utility classes; avoid custom CSS unless necessary.
‚Ä¢ Type Safety: Use TypeScript everywhere; avoid any type; define interfaces for data structures.
‚Ä¢ Testing: All new features or logic must be accompanied by tests. Backend API endpoints should have integration tests (Jest + Supertest). Frontend components should have unit/integration tests (Jest + React Testing Library). Aim for at least 80% test coverage on new code. Tests should live in a **tests** or /tests folder mirroring the main app structure. Include at least one test for expected use, one edge case, and one failure case. Always mock calls to services like DB and LLM in tests.
‚Ä¢ Documentation: Add JSDoc comments to all new exported functions. Update README.md if changes affect setup, dependencies, or environment variables.
‚Ä¢ Development Workflow: Create a new feature branch from the main development branch (e.g., feature/budget-creation-wizard). After feature complete and tested, open a pull request with clear description referencing TASK.md. Mark task as complete in TASK.md after PR merge. Add new sub-tasks or TODOs discovered during development to TASK.md. Commit frequently with clear messages.
‚Ä¢ Prisma First: All database schema changes must be done through Prisma migrations (pnpm --filter api prisma migrate dev). Do not alter the database directly.
‚Ä¢ Zod for Validation: All data coming into the API (from client) or external sources must be validated using Zod schemas.
‚Ä¢ Avoid Bad Practices: Never delete or overwrite existing code unless explicitly instructed or part of a TASK.md task. Never hardcode sensitive values. Never skip input validation. Never commit secrets to version control. Never create circular dependencies. Never put business logic in UI components. Never bypass the established authentication system. Never create direct database connections outside of the ORM layer. Never ignore error handling in async operations. Never add dependencies without checking availability. Never use deprecated libraries or methods. Never import entire libraries when only specific functions are needed. Never use different libraries for the same purpose without justification.
