## üêõ Discovered During Development

### Technical Debt

*Items discovered during development that need attention.*

- The `storybook@latest init` command can hang or fail due to command syntax or network issues. Verbose logging (`pnpm --reporter=verbose ...`) is the first step to debug.
- [ ] **Upgrade to TypeScript 6**: Once TypeScript 6 is released as a stable version, plan and execute the upgrade to leverage new language features and improvements.

### Bug Fixes

#### Critical issues found during testing

### Performance Optimizations

#### Performance improvements identified during development

## üìà Milestones & Deadlines

### Major Milestones

- **M1**: Basic static site live on Cloud Run (Sprint 1) - **COMPLETED**
- **M2**: CI/CD pipeline fully automated (Sprint 1) - **COMPLETED**
- **M3**: Foundational testing and quality gates established (Sprint 2)
- **M4**: Backend API and database setup initiated (Backlog)

## üìù Notes & Considerations

### Development Priorities

1. **Speed to Live**: Establish the full deployment pipeline first.
2. **Technical Foundation**: Ensure quality gates are in place before scaling.
3. **Security First**: All financial data handling must be secure.
4. **Mobile Experience**: Primary focus on mobile usability.
5. **South African Context**: Cultural and economic relevance is crucial.
