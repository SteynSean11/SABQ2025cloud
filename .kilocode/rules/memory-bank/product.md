Product Vision: SA Budget Queen
1. The Problem We Are Solving
The product addresses the unique economic pressures faced by young and middle-aged South Africans. Many struggle with challenges like "black tax," high data costs, and a volatile economy, and find that generic budgeting advice from other regions doesn't apply to their reality. They need practical, relatable, and empowering tools to manage their finances effectively. [cite: PLANNING.md]

Target User:
Young South African women (22-35 years old) who are starting their careers or managing young families. They are tech-savvy but may not be financial experts, and primarily use mobile devices. [cite: PLANNING.md]

User Story Example:

As a young professional in South Africa, I want to track my monthly spending against my budget simply, so that I can identify where my money is going and start saving for a down payment on a house.

2. How the Product Should Function
The product should feel like an empathetic and knowledgeable financial guide. The initial user journey focuses on getting set up and tracking expenses easily.

Key Feature 1: Budget Creation Wizard
Functionality: A guided, multi-step process that helps users create their first budget. It will use templates based on common South African salary structures and allow users to set financial goals. [cite: PLANNING.md]

User Flow:

User signs up and is prompted to start the budget wizard.

User inputs their monthly income.

User selects from pre-defined expense categories (e.g., groceries, transport, data) and allocates funds.

The system generates a summary of their budget (Income vs. Expenses).

3. User Experience (UX) Goals
Empowering & Encouraging: The interface should have a "You've got this, sisi!" vibe, making users feel capable and supported. [cite: BRANDID.md]

Clarity & Simplicity: Avoid financial jargon. Break down complex concepts into easily digestible chunks. [cite: PLANNING.md]

Trustworthy & Secure: The design must clearly communicate security (especially for future financial data integration) with visual cues and transparent policies. [cite: BRANDID.md]

Gritty & Real: The visual language should be authentic and relatable to the South African context, avoiding overly polished, generic stock imagery. [cite: BRANDID.md]
