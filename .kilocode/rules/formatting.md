Code Formatting Rules
This document defines the automated code formatting standards for the SA Budget Queen project. These rules are enforced by Prettier and ESLint.

Indentation: Use spaces, not tabs.

Indent Width: 2 spaces.

Semicolons: Always add semicolons at the end of statements.

Quotes: Use single quotes for strings.

Trailing Commas: Add trailing commas where valid in multi-line statements (es5).

Line Length: Maximum line length is 80 characters.

Bracket Spacing: Add spaces between brackets in object literals (e.g., { foo: bar }).

Import Order: Imports should be sorted into groups: external libraries first, then internal absolute-path imports (@/), and finally relative imports (./ or ../).
